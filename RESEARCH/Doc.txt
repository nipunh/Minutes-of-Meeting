üëç      audio
        AudioSource     An AudioSource object that provides the audio that is to be transcribed. 

üëç      content_type
        str 
                        The format (MIME type) of the audio. For more information about specifying an audio format, see Audio formats (content types) in the method description. 
        Allowable values: [application/octet-stream, audio/alaw, audio/basic, audio/flac, audio/g729, audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg, audio/ogg;codecs=opus, audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm, audio/webm;codecs=opus, audio/webm;codecs=vorbis]

üëç      recognize_callback
        object 
                        A RecognizeCallback object that defines methods to handle events from the WebSocket connection. Override the definitions of the object's default methods to respond to events as needed by your application. 

üëç      model
        str 
                        The identifier of the model that is to be used for the recognition request. See Languages and models. 
        Allowable values: [ar-AR_BroadbandModel,de-DE_BroadbandModel,en-GB_BroadbandModel,en-GB_NarrowbandModel,en-US_BroadbandModel,en-US_NarrowbandModel,en-US_ShortForm_NarrowbandModel,es-ES_BroadbandModel,es-ES_NarrowbandModel,fr-FR_BroadbandModel,fr-FR_NarrowbandModel,ja-JP_BroadbandModel,ja-JP_NarrowbandModel,ko-KR_BroadbandModel,ko-KR_NarrowbandModel,pt-BR_BroadbandModel,pt-BR_NarrowbandModel,zh-CN_BroadbandModel,zh-CN_NarrowbandModel]
        Default: en-US_BroadbandModel 

üëé      language_customization_id
        str 
                        The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used for the request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model specified with the model parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. Omit the parameter to use the specified model with no custom language model. See Custom models. 
        Note: Use this parameter instead of the deprecated customization_id parameter. 

üëé      acoustic_customization_id
        str 
                        The customization ID (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is to be used for the request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the model parameter. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model. Omit the parameter to use the specified model with no custom acoustic model. See Custom models. 

üëé      customization_weight
        float 
                        If you specify a customization ID, you can use the customization weight to tell the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for the current request. 
        Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when the custom model was trained. 
        The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases. 
        See Custom models. 

üëé      base_model_version
        str 
                        The version of the specified base model that is to be used for the request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. See Base model version. 
  
üñê      inactivity_timeout
        int 
                        The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is detected in the audio, the connection is closed. The default is 30 seconds. The parameter is useful for stopping audio submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use -1 for infinity. See Inactivity timeout. 
        Default: 30 

üëç      interim_results
        boolean bool 
                        If true, the service returns interim results as a stream of JSON SpeechRecognitionResults objects. If false, the service returns a single SpeechRecognitionResults object with final results only. See Interim results. 
        Default: false 

üëé      keywords
        list[str] 
                        An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or more string tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final results, not in interim hypotheses. If you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords. Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords. See Keyword spotting. 

üëé      keywords_threshold
        float 
                        A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. See Keyword spotting. 

üñê      max_alternatives
        int 
                        The maximum number of alternative transcripts that the service is to return. By default, a single transcription is returned. See Maximum alternatives. 
        Default: 1 

üñê      word_alternatives_threshold
        float 
                        A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter. See Word alternatives. 

üëç      word_confidence
        bool 
                        If true, the service returns a confidence measure in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 for each word. By default, no word confidence measures are returned. See Word confidence. 
        Default: false 

üñê      timestamps
        bool 
                        If true, the service returns time alignment for each word. By default, no timestamps are returned. See Word timestamps. 
        Default: false 

        profanity_filter
        bool 
                        If true, the service filters profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to false to return results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only. See Profanity filtering. 
        Default: true 

üëé      smart_formatting
        bool 
                        If true, the service converts dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword strings to punctuation symbols. By default, no smart formatting is performed. Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only. See Smart formatting. 
        Default: false 

üñê      speaker_labels
        bool 
                        If true, the response includes labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, no speaker labels are returned. Specifying true forces the timestamps parameter to be true, regardless of whether you specify false for that parameter. 
        To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the Get a model method and check that the attribute speaker_labels is set to true. See Speaker labels. 
        Default: false 

üëé      http_proxy_host
        str 
                        If you are passing requests through a proxy, specify the host name of the proxy server. Use the http_proxy_port parameter to specify the port number at which the proxy listens. Omit both parameters if you are not using a proxy. 
        Default: None 

üëé       http_proxy_port
        str 
                        If you are passing requests through a proxy, specify the port number at which the proxy service listens. Use the http_proxy_host parameter to specify the host name of the proxy. Omit both parameters if you are not using a proxy. 
        Default: None 

üëé      customization_id
        str 
                        Deprecated. Use the language_customization_id parameter to specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the request. Do not specify both parameters with a request. 

üëé      grammar_name
        str 
                        The name of a grammar that is to be used with the recognition request. If you specify a grammar, you must also use the parameter to specify the name of the custom language model for which the grammar is defined. The service recognizes only strings that are recognized by the specified grammar; it does not recognize other custom words from the model's words resource. See Grammars. 

üëé      redaction
        bool 
                        If true, the service redacts, or masks, numeric data from final transcripts. The feature redacts any number that has three or more consecutive digits by replacing each digit with an X character. It is intended to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit card numbers. By default, no redaction is performed. 
        When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart formatting, regardless of whether you explicitly disable that feature. To ensure maximum security, the service also disables keyword spotting (ignores the keywords and keywords_threshold parameters) and returns only a single final transcript (forces the max_alternatives parameter to be 1). 
        See Numeric redaction. 
        Default: false
