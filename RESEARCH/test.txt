What are you doing now?
I'm playing pool with my friends at a pool Hall.
I don't know you play pool are you having fun.
I'm having a great time how about you what are you doing?
I'm taking a break from homework. There seems to be no end to the amount of work I have to do.
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.
